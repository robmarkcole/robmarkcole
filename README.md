### Robin Cole

My background is physics, and I have a PhD from the [NanoPhotonics group at Cambridge](https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/) on the topic of [localised surface Plasmons](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl0710506). Since academia I have held a variety of roles in industry, including undertaking research at the former [Sharp Labs of Europe](https://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/), developing optical systems at [Surrey Satellites](https://www.sstl.co.uk/), working at an IOT startup and a brief stint in e-commerce. Over time I have gravitated towards data analytics and machine learning with python, and I currently work as a senior data scientist at [Satellite Vu](https://www.satellitevu.com/).
