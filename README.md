### Dr Robin Cole

My background is optical physics, and I have a PhD from the [NanoPhotonics group at Cambridge](https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/) on the topic of [localised surface Plasmons](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl0710506). Since academia I have held a variety of roles, including doing research at [Sharp Labs Europe](https://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/), developing optical systems at [Surrey Satellites](https://www.sstl.co.uk/) (SSTL), and working at an IOT startup. Over time I have steadily gravitated towards data analytics and software engineering with python, and I now work as a senior data scientist at [Satellite Vu](https://www.satellitevu.com/). My main activities on Github involve in the practical application of machine learning, and I have a number of small personal projects around developing neural networks for deployment on edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. I am very actively involved in two community projects; [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) and [Deepstack AI](https://github.com/johnolafenwa/DeepStack).
