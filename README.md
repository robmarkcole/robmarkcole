### Robin Cole

My background is in optical physics, and I hold a PhD from the [NanoPhotonics group at Cambridge](https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/) on the topic of surface plasmons. Since academia I have held a variety of roles in industry, including as a researcher at the former Sharp Labs of Europe, and later as an engineer of optical systems at [Surrey Satellites](https://www.sstl.co.uk/). Over time I have gravitated towards data science and deep learning with python, and I now work as a senior data scientist at [Satellite Vu](https://www.satellitevu.com/). If you find my work useful please give it a star and consider sponsoring it. You can also follow me on the platforms below. Thanks!
